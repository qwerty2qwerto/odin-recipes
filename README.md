The Odin Project 1: Recipes

I made this small MF DOOM inspired cookbook website using the command line and very basic HTML (with beginner concepts e.g. anchoring for hyperlinks and images, text formatting, etc). I also used Git and GitHub as a VCS and practiced committing. This was my first ever project in The Odin Project and a first step towards learning webdev.
